# Music Releases
The Music Releases app is designed to showcase albums and singles, focusing on the implementation of React components and props.

## Dependency Installation & Startup Development Server

1.Run npm i to install dependencies.
2. Use code . to open the code in Visual Studio Code.
3. Start the development server with npm run dev in your terminal.

## The challange
The app seamlessly displays both singles and albums, featuring a sidebar as well. Notably, when an album involves multiple artists, their names are presented with commas, and the last one is separated by an "&". The app incorporates CSS hover effects and includes SVG icons when hover over an image.


## Technologies Used
### React:
The core of the app is built using React, a JavaScript library for building user interfaces.

### Props:
Props are employed to pass data between React components, facilitating the dynamic display of music releases.
