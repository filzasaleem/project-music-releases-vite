A project by [Filza Saleem](https://github.com/filzasaleem) and [Lina Dam ](https://github.com/Picsies)

# Music Releases
The Music Releases app is designed to showcase albums and singles, focusing on the implementation of React components and props.

## Dependency Installation & Startup Development Server
1.Run npm i to install dependencies.
2. Use code . to open the code in Visual Studio Code.
3. Start the development server with npm run dev in your terminal.

## The challange
The app seamlessly displays both singles and albums, featuring a sidebar as well. Notably, when an album involves multiple artists, their names are presented with commas, and the last one is separated by an "&". The app incorporates CSS hover effects and includes SVG icons when hover over an image. The app is responsive.

## Technologies Used
### React:
The core of the app is built using React, a JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
### Props:
Props are employed to pass data between React components, facilitating the dynamic display of music releases.

## Future work
As the Music Releases app evolves, there are key areas for improvement and expansion:
### Styling Sidebar:
Enhance the visual appeal and user experience by refining the styling of the sidebar. hamburger menue can be added for the sidebar.
### API Integration:
Transition from using a JSON file to a dynamic API for fetching music release data. This allows for real-time updates and a more seamless user experience with the latest releases.

By addressing these areas, the Music Releases app can continue to evolve into a more feature-rich and visually appealing platform.
